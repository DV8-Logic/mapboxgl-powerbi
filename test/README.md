### Running the tests

A Mapbox Access Token is required to run the tests. If you don't have one you can get it here: [https://mapbox.com/signup]  

The token has to be set in the MAPBOX_TOKEN variable.

```
export MAPBOX_TOKEN=<<your_token>>
yarn test
```

or 

```
MAPBOX_TOKEN=<<your_token>> yarn test
```
