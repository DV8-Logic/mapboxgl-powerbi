# Mapbox Visual for Microsoft Power BI

Make sense of your big & dynamic location data with the Mapbox Visual for Power BI.  Quickly design high-performance map visuals using graduated circles, clusters, and interactive heatmaps.  Even customize your Mapbox visual with custom shapes, imagery, and design using [Mapbox Studio](www.mapbox.com/studio).  Check out the [Mapbox Gallery](https://www.mapbox.com/gallery/) to get a sense of what's possible with Studio.

Drop in the Mapbox Visual to your Power BI dashboard from the [Microsoft Office Store](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/power-bi-visuals/WA104381472?tab=Overview).
